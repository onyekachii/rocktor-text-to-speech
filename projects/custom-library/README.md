# Rocktor's Text-To-Speech with Highlighter

A simple angular component which implements a text reader as well as word highlighting. A big advantage of this implementation is that it can also read text from HTML markup and avoid reading HTML entities. This feature successfully solves the problem of reading and highlighting unwanted text (html tags and entities).

## Features

* Text-to-Speech reader
* Accepts HTML markup and entitites
* Highlighter
* Auto scrolling

## Installation/Setup and Usage

* Install npm package
```bash
npm i rocktor-text-to-speech-and-highlighter-angular
```
* Ensure RocktorTextToSpeechModule is impoerted in root module or component
* On your component.html file:
```html
<app-text-reader [text]="textToRead"></app-text-reader>
``` 
Optional attributes:
* controlHorizontalPosition: Sets the horizontal position of the media control buttons. Values include HorizontalPosition.center, HorizontalPosition.left and HorizontalPosition.right.
```typescript
import { HorizontalPosition } from ...
...
...
...
controlPosition = HorizontalPosition.center;
```
```html
<app-text-reader [text]="textToRead" [controlHorizontalPosition]="controlPosition"></app-text-reader>
```
* showHighlight: a boolean value to activate or deactivate highlighting
* highlightStyle: styles highlighted word. Only three css properties (shown below) are should to be set as they reset after text after reader stops.
```typescript
highlightStyle = "font-size: 20em; font-weight: 700; color: blue";
```

## Limitation

One known limitation is observed in the highlighing of words on android browser. An anomaly with SpeechSynthesisUtterance.OnBoundary event causes a bug that prevents the highligher from working. This bug is a known issue for android browsers like google chrome
